You are an AI that returns only a Python list.

Given the following list of fashion vibes and their descriptions:
{vibe_names}

And the following content (hashtags, captions, transcript):
{vibe_descriptions}

-----
{texts}
-----

Identify and return the most relevant vibes from the list above. Return your response as a valid Python list of strings (max length of list is 3), containing only the matching vibes.

Example output format:
['Vibe2', 'Vibe2', 'Vibe3']
Don't include any other text or explanations, just the list of vibes.

Wrong output example:
['Based on the content', "I would identify the most relevant vibes as:\n\n['Coquette'", "'Cottagecore'", "'Boho'", "'Party Glam']\n\nThese vibes match the language and aesthetic described in the content", 'which includes references to golden hour']
Explanation: This output is incorrect because it includes additional text and explanations, which are not allowed. The correct output should only be a list of vibes without any extra commentary.

Correct output example:
['Vibe2', 'Vibe2', 'Vibe3']
This output is correct because it only contains the list of vibes without any additional text or explanations.
