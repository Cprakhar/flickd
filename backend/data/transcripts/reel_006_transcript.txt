 Hi, my name is Zeneca Juggesian. I am a Down syndrome Allocate model and co-founder of Homebred by GNZ. So my journey was very random and unplanned. I love to try to explore different styles and work with different people. I won't lie at all. I have the most amazing feeling to be on such a big international magazine, The Work. It was like a different kind of a feeling and it meant a lot to me and my family. So during the shoot of The Work, what I really realized was that I started to love the camera. And I also realized how I love the attention. I've become so confident in front of the camera now. And that's how I got love for modeling. Yes, I have been truly grateful and blessed that how I perceive Down syndrome, right? Down syndrome is just a condition that we are born with. And it doesn't determine how your present or your future will be. I just want everyone to understand that. So my message is very simple. Believe in yourself and then believe in others. Press positivity. Don't bring people down. If you are in a position of giving opportunities, then not just people with Down syndrome but with other conditions too, please do.
